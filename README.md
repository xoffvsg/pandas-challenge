## Introduction
This report evaluates the academic achievements in math and reading of 39,170 high schoolers distributed over 15 different schools.
The size of the schools ranges from 427 students to 4,976 students. Eight of the schools are charter schools and seven are district schools.

The data is analyzed to find indicators if the results of the students might be related to either the spending per student, the size of the school, or the type of the school (charter vs. district).
The details of the write-up are in the Jupyter notebook.
